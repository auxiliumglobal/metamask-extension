Dear Auxilium Browser Plug-in Users,

There have been several instances of high-profile legitimate websites such as BTC Manager and Games Workshop that have had their websites temporarily compromised. This involves showing a fake Auxilium Browser Plug-in window on the page asking for user's seed phrases. Auxilium Browser Plug-in will never open itself in this way and users are encouraged to report these instances immediately to either [our phishing blacklist](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect/issues) or our support email at [support@metamask.io](mailto:support@metamask.io).
